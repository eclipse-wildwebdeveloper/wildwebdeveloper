### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking extensions ‚ö†Ô∏è Move to LemMinX 0.12.0

LemMinX XML language server was upgraded to 0.12.0, with a lot of improvements. However, please note that the extension API has changed in a non-backward compatible way; so to work with newer Wild Web Developer, ensure the extensions to `org.eclipse.wildwebdeveloper.xml.lemminx` are compatible with LemMinX 0.12.0.

## 0.10.0

* üìÖ Release Date (tentative): Early June 2020
* All changes: https://github.com/eclipse/wildwebdeveloper/compare/0.9.1...0.10.0

#### Extension point to define initializationOptions to LemMinX XML Language Server

The extension point `org.eclipse.wildwebdeveloper.xml` now allows a new `initializationOptionsProvider` child element type, which can be used to specify some initialize options. This is typically useful for language server who should be configured according some some user preferences already configured somewhere else in the IDE, so such preferences can be propageted to the language server.

#### Extension point to define JSON Schema URLs

The extension point `org.eclipse.wildwebdeveloper.json.schema` allows record JSON schema for filename pattern. This records are registered in JSON Language Server during initialization:

```xml
<extension point="org.eclipse.wildwebdeveloper.json.schema">
      <schema pattern="composer.json" url="http://json.schemastore.org/composer" />
</extension>
```

#### Install XML support separately

A feature containing XML editor was extracted and can be installed separately, without installing all other Web tools (HTML, JS and so on).

When debugging against Chrome/Chromium, the related Debug Configurations now shows an extra tab that allow to select the browser instance to use.

## 0.8.1

üìÖ Release Date: January 20th, 2020

#### Proxy honored for XML resolution

The proxy settings are now used by the XML edition assistance (eg to resolve XSD elements). The network settings of Eclipse IDE are used, and if the network settings are blank, the related System Properties of the running/host Eclipse process itself are forwarded to XML resolution. _This fixes issue #192._  

#### ESLint and Typescript-ESLint support

[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is now supported in Wild Web Developer, providing both code diagnostics and quick fixes (when available) for JavaScript and Typescript files.

To enable ESLint for a project, a `.eslintrc`, `tsconfig.json` as well as the required `node_modules` must reside within the project's directory (or in a parent directory). The required `node_modules` can be installed with `npm install eslint@6.0.0 @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin@2.7.0 @typescript-eslint/parser@2.7.0 typescript@3.6.4`.

An example `.eslintrc` can be found [here](org.eclipse.wildwebdeveloper.tests/testProjects/eslint/.eslintrc) and a example `tsconfig.json` can be found [here](org.eclipse.wildwebdeveloper.tests/testProjects/eslint/tsconfig.json)  

For more information on configuring ESLint, visit https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring.

#### Improved XML language server extensibility

Extension point to add jars to XML Language Server has been augmented to allow passing a dynamic resolution of multiple jars.

## 0.8.0

üìÖ Release Date: 19th November, 2019

#### XML language server extension support

XML-LS extension jars can now be integrated into Wild Web Developer through the xmllsExtension extension point, allowing additional functionality to be provided from the language server.

The extension jars must implement the **IXMLExtension interface** and must register with Java Service Provider Interface (SPI) mechanism in the **/META-INF/services/org.eclipse.lsp4xml.services.extensions.IXMLExtension** file.
To use the extension point, create an xmllsExtension extension in a plug-in project and set the path to the location of the extension jar (which must reside within the plug-in project).

Usage example:

```xml
    <extension
          point="org.eclipse.wildwebdeveloper.xml.xmllsExtension">
       <jar
             path="path/to/extension.jar">
       </jar>
    </extension>
```

assistance (validation, completion, go to definition...) for template strings in TypeScript files and
template HTML files, among other Angular-specific features.
