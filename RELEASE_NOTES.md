#### Easily define root mapping for remote node.js debugger

When debugging a remote process on a different filesystem, the related Debug Configuration now allows to easily define the root and local path to map together, so breakpoint and file references are correctly used by both client and server

## 0.8.1

üìÖ Release Date: January 20th, 2020

#### Proxy honored for XML resolution

The proxy settings are now used by the XML edition assistance (eg to resolve XSD elements). The network settings of Eclipse IDE are used, and if the network settings are blank, the related System Properties of the running/host Eclipse process itself are forwarded to XML resolution. _This fixes issue #192._  

#### ESLint and Typescript-ESLint support

[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is now supported in Wild Web Developer, providing both code diagnostics and quick fixes (when available) for JavaScript and Typescript files.

To enable ESLint for a project, a `.eslintrc`, `tsconfig.json` as well as the required `node_modules` must reside within the project's directory (or in a parent directory). The required `node_modules` can be installed with `npm install eslint@6.0.0 @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin@2.7.0 @typescript-eslint/parser@2.7.0 typescript@3.6.4`.

An example `.eslintrc` can be found [here](org.eclipse.wildwebdeveloper.tests/testProjects/eslint/.eslintrc) and a example `tsconfig.json` can be found [here](org.eclipse.wildwebdeveloper.tests/testProjects/eslint/tsconfig.json)  

For more information on configuring ESLint, visit https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring.

#### Improved XML language server extensibility

Extension point to add jars to XML Language Server has been augmented to allow passing a dynamic resolution of multiple jars.

## 0.8.0

üìÖ Release Date: 19th November, 2019

#### XML language server extension support

XML-LS extension jars can now be integrated into Wild Web Developer through the xmllsExtension extension point, allowing additional functionality to be provided from the language server.

The extension jars must implement the **IXMLExtension interface** and must register with Java Service Provider Interface (SPI) mechanism in the **/META-INF/services/org.eclipse.lsp4xml.services.extensions.IXMLExtension** file.
To use the extension point, create an xmllsExtension extension in a plug-in project and set the path to the location of the extension jar (which must reside within the plug-in project).

Usage example:

```xml
    <extension
          point="org.eclipse.wildwebdeveloper.xml.xmllsExtension">
       <jar
             path="path/to/extension.jar">
       </jar>
    </extension>
```

## 0.7.0

üìÖ Release Date: October 11th, 2019

##### Angular template edition assistance (in HTML and TypeScript)

Wild Web Developer adopts new version of the ng-language-server, and includes support for rich edition
assistance (validation, completion, go to definition...) for template strings in TypeScript files and
template HTML files, among other Angular-specific features.
