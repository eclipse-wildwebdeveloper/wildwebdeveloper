Edition assistance should be improved on many aspects, and several bugs now fixed.

#### Refactored ESLint support

ESLint support is now a standalone language server, which doesn't require TypeScript, tsconfig nor anything else tan plain ESLint configuration files to work.

## 0.8.1

üìÖ Release Date: January 20th, 2020

#### Proxy honored for XML resolution

The proxy settings are now used by the XML edition assistance (eg to resolve XSD elements).

#### ESLint and Typescript-ESLint support

[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is now supported in Wild Web Developer, providing both code diagnostics and quick fixes (when available) for JavaScript and Typescript files.

To enable ESLint for a project, a `.eslintrc`, `tsconfig.json` as well as the required `node_modules` must reside within the project's directory (or in a parent directory). The required `node_modules` can be installed with `npm install eslint@6.0.0 @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin@2.7.0 @typescript-eslint/parser@2.7.0 typescript@3.6.4`.

An example `.eslintrc` can be found [here](org.eclipse.wildwebdeveloper.tests/testProjects/eslint/.eslintrc) and a example `tsconfig.json` can be found [here](org.eclipse.wildwebdeveloper.tests/testProjects/eslint/tsconfig.json)

#### XML language server extension support

XML-LS extension jars can now be integrated into Wild Web Developer through the xmllsExtension extension point, allowing additional functionality to be provided from the language server.

The extension jars must implement the **IXMLExtension interface** and must register with Java Service Provider Interface (SPI) mechanism in the **/META-INF/services/org.eclipse.lsp4xml.services.extensions.IXMLExtension** file.
To use the extension point, create an xmllsExtension extension in a plug-in project and set the path to the location of the extension jar (which must reside within the plug-in project).

Usage example:

```xml
    <extension
          point="org.eclipse.wildwebdeveloper.xml.xmllsExtension">
       <jar
             path="path/to/extension.jar">
       </jar>
    </extension>
```
