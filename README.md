# Wild Web Developer : Web dev in Eclipse IDE

Wild Web Developer is a set of functionalities for the Eclipse IDE to provide simple and efficient Web development (HTML, CSS, JS, JSon, Node.js...). It's meant to be an alternative to traditional Eclipse Web Tools Platform (WTP).

Wild Web Developer is based on the Eclipse Generic Editor framework from Eclipse Platform, LSP4E and TM4E in order to provide editors based on TextMate grammars and VSCode Language Server, and on Eclipse Debug stack, LSP4E Debug Adapter Protocol support and VSCode Node Debug Adapter to provide debugging.

See ▶️ http://www.screencast.com/t/BaC9DxHIqD for a demo of editor in action.
